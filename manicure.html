<h2>Manicure</h>
<h3>What is a manicure?</h3>
<p> A manicure is a beauty treatment of the hands. 
    Your nails will be cut, filed, and shaped. 
    You will then have your cuticles pushed back and tidied, and then enjoy a hand massage.
     The final step will be the painting of the nails with a colour of your choice.

        <h3><strong>Natural Nail Care</strong></h3>
        <p>We are all familiar with the classic nail polish that comes in just about every colour you can 
            think of. Last up to 5 days, nail polish is thinner than gel polish and can be left to dry naturally. If you want
               to give your nails a fresh nail polish colour, you don't need a LED lamp. </p>

        <h3><strong>Gel Manicure</strong></h3>
        <p>A gel manicure is a coat of colored gel that looks deceptively similar to nail polish. It's a thin
             brush-on formula, designed for high performance and a glossier finish than regular nail polish. 
             When it comes to the question of "How long do gel nails last?" In fact, an OPI GelColor
              manicure lasts for up to 2 weeks. </p>

        <h3><strong>Nail Enhancement</strong></h3>
        <p>If you are someone who follows the latest trends when it comes to new nail shapes and prefer longer lengths, 
            then acrylic nails are for you. Acrylic nails typically last between 2-3 weeks and can be ‘filled’ to help accommodate the growth
             of your natural nail.</p>
